# Labor Law Compliance Analysis for Healthcare Company
This project analyzes synthetic employee timecard data to track compliance with key labor laws, focusing on minimum breaks taken before the fifth hour of work and adherence to scheduled work times.

## Executive Summary
To help ensure labor law compliance, this project analyzes employee work data to confirm that schedules are followed accurately and mandatory breaks are taken before the fifth hour of the employee's day.

By highlighting scheduling deviations, missed breaks, and inaccurate time reporting, this solution reduces legal risks, improves operational oversight, and supports fair workplace practices. It equips leadership with the insights needed to manage their workforce effectively and maintain compliance with labor regulations.

## Business Impact
Correctly rendered schedules and mandatory breaks are hallmarks of labor law compliance. Incorrectly recorded time or insufficient breaks can lead to legal risks, employee dissatisfaction, and operational inefficiencies. How can we identify employees who have missed their break or rendered time inaccurately? Proper analysis of schedule and timecard data helps prevent potential employee legal actions by ensuring compliance with labor laws. This project aims to highlight potential labor law compliance risks for executive level and scheduling teams by providing a list of employees and high-level overviews of the entire workforce.

## Methodology
Starting with a synthetic excel file from a scheduling system as well as a randomized employee demographics dataset, the project approach involves:
  **Data Integration:** Combining schedule details with actual worked hours for each employee.
  **Time Conversion:** Standardizing time values into a consistent format for easy comparison.
  **Session Analysis:** Grouping daily work sessions to calculate total hours worked, count breaks, and measure break durations.
  **Compliance Checks:** Identifying if employees took mandatory breaks before their fifth hour of work and if their rendered times match their scheduled times.
  **Flagging Violations:** Highlighting employees or days where the rules were not followed, enabling proactive corrections.
